# Project 4

This project is an ecommerce app of clothes called Le Cl√©. 
The user can sign up, log in, click on a product and see more information about it, add the product to his cart, see the total of his purchases on the "My cart" page and enter payment information.

## Tech Stack
React, JavaScript, Express, CSS

## Plan
I spent my first day planning what features I'd like to have and setting up the minimum structure of the project. This included setting up the databases for users, products and carts using SQL and then using Node.js and Express to set an API using both front-end and back-end architecture. 


## Unsolved Issues and Future Improvements
Fix cart feature
Create product categories
Create type of user (add admin mode)
Create add product feature
Improve CSS: add carousel and icons
